# Stellar Project (Real Estate)
Smart contracts can be used to record property ownership of any structure. They can also optimize transaction speed and efficiency by reducing the need for lawyers or brokers, allowing sellers to take charge of the process.

Smart contracts have also been used in the industry to automate and secure processes like:

Property Transactions: Automatically execute property sales when conditions like payment confirmation are met, reducing the need for intermediaries.
Lease Agreements: Automate rental agreements and payments, ensuring timely transactions and reducing disputes.
Escrow Services: Securely hold funds until all terms of a real estate deal are fulfilled, releasing them automatically upon completion.
Title Management: Record property ownership and transfer titles securely on the blockchain, enhancing transparency and reducing fraud.
